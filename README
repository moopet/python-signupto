This intends to be a wrapper for all Sign-up.to's APIs, but for now it's just
the Subscription Manager API

You need to add your server's IP address to the whitelist on signup.to's API settings page, and grab yourself the API keys.
If you want to import CSVs of info through SCP you'll also need to contact them to get their public key, which for some
reason isn't... public.

Get started:

    import signupto.api
    api = signupto.api.SubscriptionAPI(api_hash="YOUR_API_HASH", cid="YOUR_CID")
    print api.get_lists()
