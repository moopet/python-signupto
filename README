This intends to be a wrapper for all Sign-up.to's APIs, but for now it's just
the Subscription Manager API, and it doesn't include the CSV upload methods
at that.


Get started:

    import signupto.api
    api = signupto.api.SubscriptionAPI(api_hash="YOUR_API_HASH_HERE", cid="YOUR_CID_HERE")
    print api.get_lists()
